# ABSTRACT

Efficiently managing vehicle parking operations is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and revenue optimization in modern parking facilities. Traditional manual parking management systems are prone to errors, operational delays, and lack the capability for real-time space tracking and automated fee calculation. To address these challenges, this project proposes an intelligent Vehicle Parking Database Management System. The system utilizes a comprehensive web-based dashboard integrated with a robust SQLite database to manage parking operations seamlessly. Leveraging modern web technologies including Node.js, TypeScript, and Express.js, the system provides real-time parking space visualization, automated vehicle entry and exit processing, and intelligent fee calculation based on configurable rate structures. The extracted parking session data is stored in a normalized SQLite database that maintains vehicle information, parking space allocation, session management, and revenue tracking with support for multiple vehicle types including cars, motorcycles, trucks, and vans. Entry and exit operations are processed automatically with real-time space availability updates, dynamic fee calculation using hourly, daily, and flat rate models, and comprehensive revenue reporting with Indian Rupee (₹) localization. The system features both a responsive web interface for facility managers and a command-line interface for system administrators, providing dual access modes for different operational requirements. This system eliminates manual calculation errors, enhances operational efficiency through automated space allocation algorithms, and ensures real-time monitoring of parking facility utilization, contributing to optimized revenue generation and improved customer experience in parking facility management.
