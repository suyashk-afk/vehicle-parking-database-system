# INTRODUCTION

Managing parking spaces efficiently is a critical operational challenge for modern urban facilities, commercial complexes, and institutional campuses that handle substantial vehicular traffic on a daily basis. Traditional parking management approaches, such as manual space allocation, paper-based fee collection, and physical monitoring systems, are plagued with numerous operational inefficiencies. These include inaccurate space utilization tracking, revenue leakage due to manual errors, inability to provide real-time availability information, and the lack of comprehensive data analytics for optimizing parking operations. As urbanization accelerates and parking demand intensifies, the limitations of conventional systems necessitate a transition towards intelligent, automated parking management solutions.

The primary challenge lies in optimizing space utilization while ensuring accurate fee calculation and seamless user experience. An effective parking management system must track vehicle entry and exit times precisely, calculate fees based on duration and vehicle type, maintain real-time space availability, and provide comprehensive reporting capabilities for operational insights. This requires a robust and scalable approach that integrates modern database technologies, web-based interfaces, and automated business logic processing.

The proposed Vehicle Parking Management System addresses these challenges by implementing a comprehensive digital solution built on TypeScript and Node.js technologies. The system employs a SQLite database to maintain persistent records of vehicles, parking spaces, sessions, and rate structures, ensuring data integrity and reliability. A sophisticated business logic layer handles space allocation algorithms, fee calculation based on configurable hourly rates, and session management with proper validation and error handling.

The system features a real-time web dashboard that provides instant visibility into parking space availability, active sessions, and revenue analytics. Vehicle entry and exit operations are processed through a RESTful API that validates license plates, allocates optimal parking spaces based on vehicle type, and calculates fees automatically upon exit. The architecture supports multiple vehicle categories including cars, motorcycles, trucks, and vans, each with distinct parking space requirements and pricing structures.

Revenue tracking and reporting capabilities enable facility managers to monitor parking utilization patterns, analyze peak usage times, and generate comprehensive financial reports. The system maintains detailed audit trails of all parking activities, ensuring transparency and accountability in operations. Advanced features include space optimization algorithms that prioritize space allocation based on vehicle size compatibility and zone-based parking management.

By leveraging modern web technologies and database management principles, the proposed system transforms traditional parking operations into an intelligent, data-driven process. It establishes a foundation for scalable parking management solutions that can adapt to varying facility sizes and operational requirements, paving the way for smart parking infrastructure that enhances both operational efficiency and user satisfaction.
